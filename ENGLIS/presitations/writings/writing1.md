# The older generations tend to have very traditional ideas about how people should live, think and behave. However, some people believe that these ideas are not helpful in preparing younger generations for modern life. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?

it's true than many older people believe in traditional values that often seem incompatiable with the needs of younger people. While i agree that some tradition ideas are outdated, I believe that 
others are still useful and should be not forgotten.

On the one hand, many of the ideas that olderly people have abount life are becoming less relevant for younger people. In the past, for example, people were advised to learn a skill and find a secure job for life, but today's worker expect much more variety and diversity
