what's up guys this is simon now i've been living in Taiwan for a while,so today i would like to talk about the thing that i like most about taiwan we all know taiwan has got a lot of fascinating things it has a variety of delicious food very beautiful natural scenery and people here are extremely friendly and supportive but if you tell me that i can only name one thing what would be the number one thing i like most about taiwan well it might sound a pretty difficult question to answer because there are so many things you can choose right, but to me this is actually a no-brainer. as an ordinary dude from mainland china the number one thing i like about taiwan is its unique system, and that system gives its people high level of freedom it builds a safe and carefree society it allows people to make decisions for their own future and last but not least it embraces the idea of equality  let me explain to you guys  so let's talk about freedom first shall we but before  we get into detail i think we should address the following question  that is what do i mean by freedom i know people may have very different  definitions of freedom right some people may think freedom means they can do  whatever the heck they want and no one bothers them such as riding a scooter  during the middle of a day while getting terribly drunk or having  the ability to tear down any kinds of posters others  may consider freedom as chaos and lack of order  to me freedom could also mean a lot of things but most importantly i think  freedom is being able to think and share our ideas freely so under that  definition Taiwan is probably one of the freest  places in asia here people are allowed to have their own opinions about  almost anything and they can share them with whoever they want  first of all taiwan doesn't have a lot of restriction when it comes to  publication which means they will be able to share  different ideas and values through books films newspaper  music and even games second of all there's very little censorship on the  internet so they can discuss all kinds of topics without concerning  that their message or account get deleted and if someone  really feels his voice needs to be heard by the  public he can even organize a peaceful protest in taiwan people are allowed to  have different views and values the government won't spend all  its mighty power to crush different voices and make sure all its citizens  have the right ideology because there is no right ideology  and let's talk about safety shall we like i've mentioned before a lot of  people think freedom and safety usually don't go together right wherever there's  freedom there's violence and disarray however  taiwan is actually the perfect example that proves that freedom and safety are  not mutually exclusive taiwan is probably one of the safest  place in the world it's got very low crime rates  anyone who has lived in taiwan knows that here you never need to be worried  about your own safety on the contrary wherever, you need any help  people will offer their support and during this pandemic  taiwan has successfully kept this novel coronavirus away from its  people so far there are only a few hundred cases  all school remain opens movie theaters gyms  bars and most public areas are open to the public and people feel safe to go to  those places and the safety is actually more than that  most importantly in taiwan people and their assets are safely protected by the  rule of law so even you piss off some very powerful  people inside the government you are still safe because here as long  as you follow the rule of law no one can harm you no one can take your  assets away because everyone is under the  rule of law including the government officials and  speaking to the government official in taiwan the government officials don't  get to tell what people should do instead the people  tell them what need to be done i know many  government officials are directly elected by the public such as local  chief executive legislators mayors and the president  here the priority for the official is to keep their voters happy  otherwise people won't vote them next time and if some of them really fail  badly people have the right to impeach them before his term is even  over besides that the politicians in taiwan constantly interact with the  public it has become extremely common for them  to discuss their future plan and policy with the public  on the internet such as youtube which i barely see in the rest of the world  in taiwan people are the real owner of this beautiful island  and government officials are indeed the public servants  not the other way around  and after having been living in taiwan  for a while i can really feel the idea that everyone  should be equal is deeply embedded in its social system  now i have dealt with public officials several times here in taiwan including  staff from the immigration office police officer on the street and  even encounter their presidential candidate once  everyone is super humble and friendly here  uh government officials are just like average joes they don't consider  themselves superior to the rest of us on tv i only see ordinary citizens yell  to the public official never saw officials dare to yell back to  the people in taiwan i think you may not be able to  make a lot of money but compared to its cost of living you can  still have a fairly decent living standard as long as you are willing to  work and taiwan has its world-leading  universal health care system which allows these people to pay  very little when they go to see the doctor  so even the poorest family in the poorest region will be able to get  proper treatment just like others from those rich areas  now i know taiwan got a lot of fascinating things but i think this  free safe engaging and relatively equal system is the backbone of taiwan it's  also the foundation that creates many other great features a lot of  people say the best scenery in taiwan is its people  yes I hundred percent agree and i want to tell them the reason why Taiwanese  are so nice is because the people here they firmly believe that  the good will be rewarded and the bad will be punished  so everyone will choose to do the right thing so in an environment like this  good nature start thriving and the bad one will start perishing  and of course taiwan isn't perfect there is still room for them to  improve i know the birth rate in taiwan is super low  and some of the public infrastructures are also getting outdated  and the minimum salary is still not on par with most of the developed country  yet and there are other challenges here and  there but with is a good system to be its foundation i'm  quite confident that taiwan will keep getting better and better in the future  so yeah if you are from taiwan i'm just gonna  say keep up the great work study hard work hard and play hard and  have kids all right and if you're not from taiwan and if you  haven't been to taiwan yet maybe after this pandemic you can  consider to book a trip to taiwan and take a look at this wonderful island  with your own eyes alright i'm not too worried that you may not  like it i'm just concerned that you may don't want to go back to your own  country after this trip just like me all right so yeah  i think that's pretty much it
