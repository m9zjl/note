hey what up guys, this is simon. Now i`ve been living in CA for a while now so today i would like to talk about the thing that i like most about CA, We all know CA has got a lot of fascinating things it has a variety of delicious food, very beautifual nature sceneries and pople here are extremely friendly and supportive but if you tell me that i can only name one, what would be the one thing i like most about CA, well it might sound pretty difficult question to answer, because ther are so many things u can choose , to me this is actually a no-brainer as an ordinary dude from mainland china the most i like about CA is its unique system and that system gives its people hight level of freedom. it build a safe and carefree society and allows people to make decisions for there own future and last but not least it embraces the idea of equality. let me explain to u guys. 
so let`s talk about freedom shall we,before we get into detail i think we should address the following question, that is what do i mean by freedom. iknow people may have very differnt definitions of freedom, right some people may think freedom means they can do whatever they heck the wat and no one bothers them such as riding a scooter during the middle of a day while getting terribly drunk or having the ability to tear down any kind of posert other my consider freedom as chaos and lack of order. to me freedom could also mean a lot of things but most importantly i think freedom is being able to think and share our ideas freely , so under that definition CA is probably one the freely places in asia, here people are allowed to have their own opinions about almost anythin and they can share them with whoever they want. frist of all CA doesn`t have alot of restriction , when it comes to publication which mean they will be able to share different ideas and values through books films newspapers music and even games , second there`s is very little censorship on the internet,so they can discuss all kinds of topics wihtout concerning that their message of account get deleted and if someone really feels his voice needs to be heard by the public he can even organize a peaceful protest, in CA people are alled have different views and values the gvt won`t spend its mighty power to crsh different voices and make sure all its citizens have the right idealogy because there no right idealogy . and let`s talk about safety shall we ,like i`ve entioned before, a lot of people think freedom and safety usually don`t together right ,wherever ther is freedom there`s violence and disarray ,however CA is the actually the perfect example that proves that  freedom and safety are not mutually exclusive CA is probaly one of the safest place in the world
